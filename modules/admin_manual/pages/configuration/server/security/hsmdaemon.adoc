= The HSM Daemon (hsmdaemon)
:hsm-url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module
:base64-encoding-url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64
:pkcs11-url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11

The hsmdaemon is a daemon to delegate encryption to an {hsm-url}[HSM (Hardware Security Module)].
It can be necessary, as PHP cannot directly interface with {pkcs11-url}[a PKCS11 stack]; neither by an API wrapper, because one does not exist, yet, nor via the OpenSSL bindings
Because of this, a separate process is needed to decrypt anything with the private key stored in an HSM. 

Running exec() to decrypt the key with a command line command to do the encryption might leak the HSM credentials if the admin lists the currently running processes. 
To prevent that an "HSM" daemon will be used that can open a session to the HSM upon startup. 
This daemon will be used by ownCloud to decrypt the current master key upon request. 
The communication will happen via UNIX or TCP sockets and is authorized by a shared token that the daemon stores in the ownCloud database via a REST/JSON route.

ownCloud internally uses OpenSSL to en-/decrypt keys and needs to be extended to support en-/decrypt operations via the new daemon. 
The current solution would be to encrypt the current ownCloud master key with a key from the HSM. 
Doing so only requires patching `KeyManagers` `getMasterKeyPassword()` and `getSystemPrivateKey()` methods to decrypt the key read from disk.

== How The HSM Daemon Interacts with ownCloud

Upon startup, the daemon will generate a token and send it to ownCloud via a new REST/JSON route. 
After connecting with the HSM daemon, an unsophisticated, line-based, protocol is used (every line ends with CRLF):

. ownCloud sends the token read from database.
. The daemon compares the received token with its token and returns an `"OK"` line.
. ownCloud then sends the data it wants to decrypt as a {base64-encoding-url}[Base64-encoded], one-line string.
. The daemon returns the decrypted data as a Base64-encoded one-line string.

Doing so ensures that an evil admin will need to wiretap the communication between either the database or the HSM daemon and ownCloud.

== Installation

=== Overview

HSM support consists of three main parts: 

. An actual HSM PKCS11 module 
. The hsmdaemon that provides a JWT protected web API for the PKCS11 stack to generate key pairs and decrypt data 
. A patch to the ownCloud encryption app

All commands are assumed to be executed as root unless stated otherwise.

=== Deployment and Resource Usage

We recommend running hsmdaemon on every Apache server to reduce latency. 
The daemon uses few resources:

[source,console]
----
$ ps aux --sort -rss | head -1
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
$ ps aux --sort -rss | grep hsm | grep -v grep
root     19568  0.0  0.0 231052  2608 ?        Ssl  Feb08   0:00 /home/jfd/Repositories/hsmdaemon/hsmdaemon
----

=== Installing a PKCS11 Module

==== Using a Preconfigured PKCS11 Module

At least one PKCS11 library is necessary. Ask the customer for the path to a fully configured PKCS11 module. 
The HSM vendor typically provides the PKCS11 module, e.g., `/opt/nfast/toolkits/pkcs11/libcknfast.so` for Thales nShield.

If none is available, you can follow the below optional steps to install a software HSM.

==== [optional] Installing SoftHSM 2

On Debian, two packages are available: `softhsm` and `softhsm2`. 
Install `softhsm2` with

[source,console]
----
apt install softhsm2
----

Installing them also installs `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so`, which is a module that we will need later, for interaction with the PKCS11 API.
The Debian location of the config file is `/etc/softhsm/softhsm2.conf`:

[source,ini]
....
# SoftHSM v2 configuration file

directories.tokendir = /var/lib/softhsm/tokens/
objectstore.backend = file

# ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
log.level = INFO
....

Make sure the `directories.tokendir` exists.
Now we can initialize the token:

[source,console]
----
softhsm2-util --init-token --slot 0 --label "My token 1"
----

It will ask for two PINs, a user and SO pin.
See https://www.opendnssec.org/softhsm/, for more information.

==== [optional] Installing PKCS11 CLI tools

To use the PKCS11 API on the CLI, we install `opensc` with:

[source,console]
----
apt install opensc
----

Now we can list the tokens with

[source,console]
----
pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so -l --pin 1234 -O
----

The module parameter is the library provided by the HSM vendor; in this case, it was installed with SoftHSM 2.
See https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki for more information.

=== Installing the hsmdaemon

Installing hsmdaemon requires several steps. 
These are:

. xref:install-the-binary[Install the Binary]
. xref:install-the-system-service[Install the System Service]
. xref:copy-the-config-file[Copy the Config File]
. xref:configure-the-pkcs11-module-path[Configure the PKCS 11 Module Path]
. xref:configure-slot-and-pin[Configure Slot and Pin]
. xref:test-key-generation[Test Key Generation]
. xref:configure-other-options[Configure Other Options]
. xref:owncloud-setup[ownCloud Setup]

==== Install the Binary

To install the hsmdaemon, you first need to install the packageâ€™s dependencies, stored in `go.mod`. To install them, run `go get`. 
The command should not show any console output and take no more than a few minutes.

Once the package dependencies are installed, you next need to compile hsmdaemon. 
To do this, use the command: `make install`, which creates the hsmdaemon binary in the `bin` directory of your `$GOPATH`, naming it `hsmdaemon`.
After compilation, you need to make the file executable and move it to a directory located in your system path.

If you are not sure which directories are in your system path, run the following script to see a complete list:

[source,console]
----
OFS=$IFS && IFS=':'
for i in $(echo $PATH); do echo $i; done;
IFS=$OFS;
----

You should see a list similar to the following:

[source,console]
----
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/bin
----

===== Installation Example

To save time, copy and paste the commands below to compile the hsmdaemon.

[source,console]
----
# Install hsmdaemon's dependencies
go get

# Compile hsmdaemon
make install

# Make the file executable
chmod +x hsmdaemon
----

==== Install the System Service

Now that the binary is available, hsmdaemon must be installed as a system service. 
To do this, run it with the `install` option, as in the example below.

[source,console]
----
$ ./hsmdaemon install
----

If it installs successfully, then you should see the following console output:

....
Install HSM Daemon:                                     [  OK  ]
....

==== Copy the Config File

Now that the hsmdaemon is ready, its config file needs to be prepared. 
The default location that hsmdaemon looks for its config file is `/etc/hsmdaemon/hsmdaemon.toml`. 
To create it from the example config file available in the cloned repository, run the following commands.

[source,console]
----
$ mkdir /etc/hsmdaemon                              # Create the hsmdaemon configuration directory
$ cp hsmdaemon.toml /etc/hsmdaemon/hsmdaemon.toml   # Copy the example config file
$ chown root /etc/hsmdaemon/hsmdaemon.toml          # Set the owner of the file to root
$ chmod 750 /etc/hsmdaemon/hsmdaemon.toml           # Allow only the root and users in the root group to read & write the configuration file
----

Have a look at the options of the executable:

[source,console]
----
$ hsmdaemon help
Usage: hsmdaemon install | remove | start | stop | status | listslots | genkey <label> | showkey <id> | parsekey | encrypt <id> <base64> | version
----

==== Configure the PKCS11 Module Path

To set the path to the PKCS11 module, update the line below in `/etc/hsmdaemon/hsmdaemon.toml`, with the appropriate path on your system.

....
[pkcs11]
module = "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so" # softhsm v2
....

==== List Available Slots

This command lists the available slots.

----

==== Configure Slot and Pin

Ask the customer which slot to use and if a PIN is needed. 
Update `/etc/hsmdaemon/hsmdaemon.toml` with the information that the customer provides, in the `pkcs11` section, as in the example below.

....
[pkcs11]
module = "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so" # softhsm v2
pin = "1234"          # The user pin supplied when running softhsm2-util --init-token, comment it out , or leave empty if no pin is necessary
slot = 1989683358     # Find your slot id with `sudo hsmdaemon listslots`
....

==== Test Key Generation

*Note:* If no PIN is supplied, generating a new key might be protected by an operator card that has to be inserted in the HSM. In this case, coordinate testing and final master key generation with the customers HSM team.

For testing key generation, run the command `hsmdaemon genkey test`, as in the following example.

[source,console]
----
$ hsmdaemon genkey test
Id: 9bac3719-2b8d-11e9-aeab-0242b5ece4c3, label: test

==== Testing Data Encryption

For testing data encryption, run the `hsmdaemon encrypt` command, as in the following example.

[source,console]
----
The first argument is the "Id:" value from running the genkey command above.
$ sudo hsmdaemon encrypt 9bac3719-2b8d-11e9-aeab-0242b5ece4c3 Zm9vYmFy
----

If successful, you should see output similar to the below example.

==== Testing Showing Keys

To show an existing key, use the `showkey` command with the keyâ€™s id, as in the following example.

[source,console]
----
sudo hsmdaemon showkey 9bac3719-2b8d-11e9-aeab-0242b5ece4c3

////
==== Testing Data Decryption

TODO.

==== Testing Key Deletion

TODO.
////

==== [optional] Configure Other Options

For more options see the self-documented default config file `hsmdaemon.toml`.

==== Run in Foreground During Setup

During ownCloud config you might want to run the service in the foreground to see what is going on:

[source,console]
----
$ ./hsmdaemon
{
    "level": "info",
    "ts": "2019-02-14T09:32:59.081+0100",
    "caller": "hsmdaemon/hsmdaemon.go:146",
    "msg": "Server listening",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8513,
    "version": "0.0.7",
    "build": "2019-02-08T10:47:55+00:00"
}
----

NOTE: The above console output is formatted for readability.

=== ownCloud Setup

==== Shut Down Apache

If anyone accesses ownCloud while encryption is enabled, it will automatically generate the keys. 
To prevent this, shut down Apache until encryption is appropriately configured.

==== Patch ownCloud

NOTE: The PR for HSM support https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/34205[is in review].

For now, we assume a fresh ownCloud installation. 
Patch the encryption app, by following the example below.

[source,console]
----
$ cd /path/to/owncloud/installation
$ patch -p1 < /path/to/hsmdaemon/patch/hsmdaemon.patch
----

==== Generate a Secret for the hsmdaemon REST API

Generate a shared secret to use for the hsmdaemon.

[source,console]
----
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid
7a7d1826-b514-4d9f-afc7-a7485084e8de
----

Use this secret for hsmdaemon in `/etc/hsmdaemon/hsmdaemon.toml`

....
[jwt]
secret = "7a7d1826-b514-4d9f-afc7-a7485084e8de"
....

Set the generated secret for ownCloud:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo -u www-data ./occ config:app:set \
    encryption hsm.jwt.secret \
    --value '7a7d1826-b514-4d9f-afc7-a7485084e8de'
----

If the command succeeds, you should see the following console output:

[source,console]
----
Config value hsm.jwt.secret for app encryption set to 7a7d1826-b514-4d9f-afc7-a7485084e8de
----

==== Configure HSM-based Encryption

Enable HSM mode and enable encryption by running the commands in the following example.

[source,console]
----
$ occ config:app:set encryption hsm.url --value 'http://localhost:8513'
$ occ app:enable encryption
$ occ encryption:enable
----

If the commands are successful, you should see the following console output:

[source,console]
----
Config value hsm.url for app encryption set to http://localhost:8513

encryption enabled

Encryption enabled

Default module: OC_DEFAULT_MODULE
----

If you want to use a single master key run

[source,console]
----
$ occ encryption:select-encryption-type masterkey
----

////
==== Configure Authorization

TBW.
////

==== Initialize and Check Generated Keys

Now start Apache, and log in with any user to initialize the keys, have a look at the output of the hsmdaemon to see key generation and decryption requests. 
Check that the private key `/path/to/data/files_encryption/OC_DEFAULT_MODULE/` is less than *1000 bytes*. 
If it is not, then something is not configured correctly. 
You have to wipe all keys and reset the database flags for encryption to get a clean start for the ownCloud setup.

TODO

* Provide occ commands for key initialization and removal. Donâ€™t rely on user login to generate keys.

=== Running as a Daemon on System Startup

==== Install as a Service

After installation, you can register hsmdaemon as a service by running the following command

[source,console]
----
$ ./hsmdaemon install
Install HSM Daemon:                                     [  OK  ]
----

==== Manage with Service Commands

It should now be running and startup automatically. 
The daemon is managed using the following three commands:

* `sudo service hsmdaemon start`
* `sudo service hsmdaemon stop` and 
* `sudo service hsmdaemon status`.
